## Anchoring and Interactivity in the Digital Age: How Online Interfaces Reshape Credit Card Repayment Decisions

*Abstract*

Suboptimal credit card repayment decisions are often driven by anchoring on low minimum payments. As financial services move to interactive digital platforms, the effects of this new choice architecture are largely unknown. This study investigates how interface design—specifically, anchor salience and interactivity—influences repayment choices. In a pre-registered online experiment, 2,503 U.S. credit cardholders were randomly assigned to one of five repayment interfaces. We find that simplicity is most effective at increasing payments: a static interface highlighting the full statement balance increased the proportion of the balance paid by 7.5 percentage points while simultaneously reducing decision times, suggesting it lowered cognitive load. In contrast, the effect of interactive sliders was entirely contingent on their default setting. A slider anchored to a low payment significantly decreased repayments, while one anchored high yielded repayments statistically indistinguishable from the control. Furthermore, interactive sliders increased decision time, indicating a greater cognitive effort in the decision. These findings provide causal evidence that in digital financial environments, simple, high-anchor static interfaces are more effective and cognitively less demanding than interactive tools, whose impact is dependent on their default settings.
